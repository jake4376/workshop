## Create a Segment to target specific users

Let's say I want to send an email to all the users who created their first event to thank and remind them what to do. You can do that by first having them in a Segment.

1. Go to **Segments**

2. Select `Create a segment` to create a dynamic segment (a group of users who will meet certain criteria)

3. Give a name `All users by email` to the segment.

4. Under Segment group 1, select `Add a filter` and choose `Filter by Channel`.

5. Now, select the channel `EMAIL`. (Note that you can create more conditions to filter and target specific users)

6. Since you might have use the app in the previous section of the workshop, you can see the Segment estimate on the right.

There are various marketing channels that can be used to reach out to the users. We are going to enable `email` as the communication channel to the users.

5. Once your email is verified, you can now go back to the AWS console (where you previous left off) and click `Save` to enable email channel.

4. Scroll down. Click `Next` to proceed.

5. Choose a segment. Select the pre-created segment `All users by email` and click `Next` at bottom right.
